"objects" like sensor, actuatos, smartphone and domestic appliance. These
devices comunicate themselves to catch up a common objetive, like accident

demand a high processing capacity, which is not always available locally.
To improve the eficiency of application, the tasks of processing more
intensive can be requested to a external server, like a virtual machine 
present in a Cloud Computing infrastructure. This project has the objective
